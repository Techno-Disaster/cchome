It's great you want to start early. Please join us in our slack channel! (we'll leave as an exercise to you to find it --- it's on our website).
This is an &amp;quot;new way of doing things year&amp;quot;. GSoC projects are now supposed to take around 175 hours and we've adapted our ideas to reflect that. If you think any idea is too long or too short please let us know - we still need to fine tune this!</description></item></channel></rss>
